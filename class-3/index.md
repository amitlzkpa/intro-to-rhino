# Practice Assignment
The objective of the assignment is to use various surface-building and surface-editing methods to generate a visualization of a set of data.  This data may be data that you find online, or data that you've collected yourself.  Consider using shape, scale, orientation, color to achieve variation based on your data.  Think about what the surface(s) represent and how you may organize objects within the template space (see link above).  For example, you may collect data on how many glasses of water you drink per day.  You could create an extruded surface, one for each day of the week, and use the extrusion height to represent the amount of water you drank.  In this case, you may organize your extrusions along a "timeline".  Let's say that, in addition to amount, you also recorded the time at which you drank the water.  Then you might have multiple extrusions for each day, and you may organize your extrusions in a grid, with one axis representing the day, and the orthogonal axis representing the time.  The template file contains the wireframe model of a cube.  Please contain your visualization within this cube.  Please upload your completed model to the link above. 
The filename should include your name.
