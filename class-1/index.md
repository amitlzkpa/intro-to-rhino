# Practice Assignment
Pick an object from the ones linked on the page below, and prepare a 2D front, top and side elevation views of them. The objects need not be very accurate. The idea is to get famiiar with the interface and basic commands covered in this class.  
Use the template file linked above to copy your final work in the respective boxes in the file and upload it to the upload file link above.  
Name the file your upload with your name.
